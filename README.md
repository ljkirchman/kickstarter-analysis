# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Reviewed the Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays

1. Plays that had a Fundraising Goal below $4,999 were highly likely to succeed.
2. February and May were ideal months to launch a show in the theater.
3. September may also be a good month to launch a show given the significantly lower failure rate.

##Further Analysis Recommendations
1. Break out the "Outcomes Based on Goal" Chart by increments of $1,000 in the $5,000 to $9,999 range to determine if the Fundraising goal should be slightly higher.
2. Conduct further analysis on campaigns between $35,000 and $45,000 to look for other factors that may contribute to a successful campaign at this funding level.
3. Conduct further analysis on "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" to determine if there is any significant correlation between the month the show was launched and its outcome; or identify another factor that does highly correlate to a successful outcome.
4. Conduct further analysis on "Outcomes Based on Goal" to determine what factors correlate to a successful outcome.

###Challenge
In this initial analysis we looked at the Outcomes Based on Goals and Outcomes Based on Launch Date.  While the data below provides some interesting insight, it is recommended to conduct further analysis to determine if there are other factors that relate to a successful show.
